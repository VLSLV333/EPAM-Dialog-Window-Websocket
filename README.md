# EPAM-Dialog-Window-Websocket

Steps to test it and see it works:
- Run npm i, npm run start in root folder.
- Open "client" folder, find index.html and right click it - select "Reveal in file explorer"
- In opened up folder double click on index.html and you should see the dialog window for first user.
- Copy the link in navigation bar and paste it in another browser, or use incognito mode.

While this 2 browsers are opened you can have dialog! Have a nice chat:)
